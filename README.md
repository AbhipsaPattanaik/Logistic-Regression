# Telecom Churn Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in a telecom company using logistic regression. Churn refers to customers who leave the service. By analyzing customer data, we aim to build a model that can predict whether a customer will churn based on features like tenure, monthly charges, contract type, and more.
